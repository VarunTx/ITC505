    <p>Addendum: 
        The main task in this assignment was to create a Holy Grail layout using CSS Grid and integrate interactive JavaScript. One issue I faced was ensuring that the content in the sidebar didn’t get pushed out of view when the main content area expanded. I had to tweak the `grid-template-columns` property to ensure that the sidebar maintained a fixed width while the content area could expand and contract as needed.

        Another challenge occurred when the advertisement image was not aligning properly within its grid cell. I fixed this by using `object-fit: cover` to ensure the image filled the space without distorting, while still maintaining its aspect ratio.

        I also ran into problems with the footer not staying at the bottom of the page when the content was minimal. I resolved this by applying `position: absolute` to the footer and setting `bottom: 0`, which ensured that the footer always stayed at the bottom of the page, regardless of the content length.

        Lastly, while trying to implement the JavaScript functionality, I encountered an issue where the result of the sorting didn’t display immediately after clicking the button. The issue was caused by the incorrect placement of the JavaScript function calls. I solved it by ensuring that the button's `onclick` attribute correctly linked to the functions defined in the `scripts.js` file, and made sure the results were dynamically updated within the right section.
  
        When I pressed the "Sort" button, the layout did not properly adjust. The main content section would expand, pushing the sidebar or other elements out of place. To resolve this, I added `gap: 20px` to the `.layout` to create spacing between the grid items.
    </p>
    <script type="text/javascript">
         var x = document.lastModified;
         document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
</footer>

        
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

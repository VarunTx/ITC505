            <h2>1. Abstract</h2>
            <p><strong>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely significantly
                on their propulsion systems, with the motor and propeller being
                vital parts in determining drone performance. This project delves
                into improving UAV performance and reliability by utilizing
                machine learning approach. which is intend to optimize drone
                motor performance by doing an in-depth analysis using regres-
                sion models. This method uses input variable throttle signal to
                estimate rotational speed and using rotational speed, voltage and
                current as input to estimate thrust and torque of multirotor
                systems, eliminating the need for extra thrust and torque sensors.
                Furthermore, we provide a strong model capable of reliably
                forecasting Motor Electrical Speed (RPM), Thrust and Torque
                from unseen data, Motor Electrical speed predictions had a
                prediction accuracy of > 97% speed with an error < 2.5% of
                the data set range for 80% of the dataset and Thrust predictions
                had a prediction accuracy > 87% thrust with an error < 6% of
                the data set range for 80% of the dataset while Torque predictions
                had a prediction accuracy > 99% torque with an error < 1.2%
                of the data set range for 80% of the dataset . Each dataset is
                rigorously reviewed to reveal significant information and insights
                of motor properties. The dataset used in this work was obtained
                from RCtestBench 1580, which provided valuable information on
                motor characteristics, electrical signals, and mechanical outputs.</strong></p>

            <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Propeller thrust and torque are the principal forces and
                moments that are applied to the motor shaft at hover or low
                speeds, and which can be easily measured on a test bench that
                is stationary. It is easy to turn on and off the motor’s three
                stages in order to check its rotational speed and challenging
                to compute the three forces and moments acting on the motor
                shaft during forward flight, though, without the aid of extra
                sensors. Study <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> modeled these forces and moments. <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>
                Designing and implementing A quadcopter’s attitude control
                algorithm must be developed through a protracted process
                that involves simulation and in-flight testing. Due to potential
                design flaws like unmodeled dynamics, most control systems
                necessitate an experimental phase on the physical system
                for validation. This is because unexpected performance can
                arise. <a href="#ref3">[3]</a> and <a href="#ref4">[4]</a> Because of this, test platforms that evaluate
                controller performance in a setting that is risk-free for both
                the user and the vehicle are required to enable the shift
                between numerical and experimental analysis. <a href="#ref5">[5]</a> Bart and Joris presented how to use the recorded rotational speed,
                throttle setting, and input voltage to sense the propeller torque
                and current of a multirotor without the need for extra torque
                sensors. Their model achieved &lt;0.01 Nm error or 4.6% of the
                data set range for 90% of the data set and &lt;0.5A error for 90%
                of cases <a href="#ref6">[6]</a> The value of thrust stand data is demonstrated
                in this study, which uses an RC Benchmark thrust stand to
                investigate the influence of a leading-edge comb adjustment
                on propeller noise and thrust <a href="#ref7">[7]</a> The study explores towards
                using machine learning, primarily neural networks, to control
                drones rather than standard pre-programmed models. It uses
                methods such as non-linear regression and neural networks to
                learn the drone’s behavior and anticipate its future motions
                <a href="#ref8">[8]</a> This research investigates three machine learning-based
                obstacle detection models for drones: a classical BP neural
                network, a classical GA-BP network, and an upgraded
                GA-BP network. All models were evaluated on a dataset of
                150 training samples. Results include convergence curves
                <a href="#ref1">[9]</a> On a thrust stand, experiments are conducted to validate
                the process. According to the findings, there is a peak in
                the thrust-to-power ratio, or overall rotor efficiency, which
                can be raised by 2% to 5% by altering the bottom rotor’s pitch</p>

            <h2>3. Methodology</h2>
            <h3><em>System Overview and Test Setup</em></h3>
            <p><strong><em>RCTestBench 1580</em></strong> is a cutting-edge platform for testing the
                performance and dependability of remote controlled devices.
                This tool aims to drastically reduce the time required for
                characterising, testing, and building brushless motor propul-
                sion systems. Table I, Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the test setup
                overview. Once attaching all the mounted parts. Prior to
                the propulsion system being fitted, the digital thrust stand
                was calibrated using an internal calibration scheme and a
                calibration weight. Next, the battery, ESC, motor, and propeller
                were mounted on the digital thrust stand. The test stand uses
                robust software for automated control and data logging, and it
                connects to your computer via USB. The Scripting Interface
                can be used to write custom programmes that can be used to
                manually operate the ESC. Additionally, safety cutoffs can be
                implemented to prevent damage to the components.</p>

                    tures from the dataset that will be used as inputs to the machine
                    learning model. The selection process considers the signifi-
                    cance of each feature in predicting the motor performance.
                    Features that have correlation and importance will be retained,
                    while irrelevant or redundant features may be excluded to
                    simplify the model.

                <p><strong>Model Selection:</strong> In this step, an appropriate machine
                    learning model is chosen to predict the motor characteristics.
                    After thorough exploration, various machine learning algo-
                    rithms were considered, with a focus on regression models.
                    This choice was informed by the observation that most of
                    the features exhibit linear relationships and possess continuous
                    values. Additionally, the selection process involved evaluating
                    each model’s performance and suitability for accurately cap-
                    turing the underlying patterns in the dataset

            <h3><em>i. Motor electrical speed model</em></h3>
            <p><strong>Lasso Regression Model:</strong> Lasso regression, also known as
                Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO),
                is a statistical technique used in machine learning to analyze
                regression. It addresses two main goals: Regularization which
                accomplishes this by using a regularization technique known
                as L1 regularization and Feature Selection which automatically
                identify and remove irrelevant features from the model. this
                penalty in lasso reduces the coefficients towards zero, and in
                rare situations, it can drive them to zero.
            </p>
            <h3><em>ii. Thrust model</em></h3>
            <p><strong>Polynomial Regression Model:</strong> Polynomial regression is a
                regression analysis technique that models relationships that are
                not necessarily linear. It accomplishes this by fitting a poly-
                nomial function to the dataset.which uses a complex equation
                of degree for the predictions. Using a low degree polynomial
                may not represent the complexity of the connection, resulting
                in a poor fit and inaccurate predictions.Using a very high
                degree polynomial may result in the model fitting the training
                data excellently but failing to generalize effectively to new
                data (overfitting). Since voltage and current have a strong
                correlation, we solely utilise voltage as it is the primary factor
                influencing thrust and helps to eliminate multicollinearity.</p>

            <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, This thorough testing and measurement pro-
                vided crucial insights into the nonlinear dynamics of bldc mo-
                tors, including metrics such as thrust, torque and Motor speed
                across a wide range of operational situations. By employing
                the regression models to analyze readily available input data,
                we have successfully eliminated the need for additional thrust
                and torque sensors. this model achieved Accurate and reliable
                predictions, unveiling hidden insights, Sensor less operation
                These findings strongly support the use of ML as an effective
                tool for drone motor modeling and to accurately forecast motor
                speed from throttle ESC input and thrust,torque from mo-
                tor speed,voltage and current input thereby improving motor
                control mechanisms for maximum stability, flight endurance,
                and energy efficiency. the integration of machine learning
                techniques not only enhances the accuracy and reliability of
                motor predictions but also heralds a new era of innovation and
                efficiency in drone technology</p>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            As I began converting the academic paper into HTML, I researched the appropriate HTML5 tags that would best reflect the structure of a formal document. My goal was to ensure that each section of the paper was marked up semantically, providing both clarity for the reader and accessibility for assistive technologies. Here’s an overview of my process and the choices I made for specific tags:
        </p>
        <p>
            Planning the Structure and Choosing `article` Tags: After researching how to structure documents in HTML, I learned that `article` is a semantic tag used for self-contained content. Given that the paper and the addendum were distinct sections, I decided to use two `article` tags: one for the main paper and another for the addendum. This clearly separates the content and makes the document easier to navigate. Each article encapsulates its own logical unit, with the first containing the body of the academic paper and the second the explanation of the HTML structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using `header` and `address` for the Title and Author Information: Initially, I thought about simply using paragraphs for the title and author names. However, after further research, I discovered that the `header` tag is specifically designed to group introductory content such as the title, and the `address` tag is used to provide contact information. Therefore, I wrapped the title and author details within a `header` block, and each author’s contact information within an `address` block to improve semantic clarity. I found that using `address` was more meaningful than just plain `p` tags because it clearly indicates to both users and browsers that this section contains the author’s contact information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Structuring the Content with `section` Tags: I initially planned to use `div` tags to separate different parts of the paper, but through my research, I found that `section` tags are more appropriate for dividing a document into thematic areas. Each major part of the paper (e.g., Abstract, Introduction, Methodology) was thus enclosed in its own `section`, with headings (`h2`) marking the beginning of each section. This choice provided better semantic structure and allows screen readers and search engines to understand the organization of the document more effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating Hierarchical Headings: I used an `h1` tag for the title of the paper and `h2` tags for major sections like “Introduction” and “Conclusion.” For subsections, such as “System Overview and Test Setup,” I used `h3` tags to maintain a clear structure.
            This made the document easier to navigate, as the headings clearly outlined the flow of the paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tables for Data Representation: When I first tried to present the component details, I used `p` tags, which didn’t provide proper structure for tabular data. After researching how to represent tabular information, I switched to using a `table` tag with `thead` for the table header and `tbody` for the body content. This allowed me to structure the data meaningfully, and the use of CSS for borders improved readability. I also added a `caption` tag to describe the table, improving accessibility for screen readers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inserting Citations with Links: At first, I just wrote out citations like [1] in plain text, but I realized this wasn’t very interactive or informative. I researched how to link citations, and I learned to use the `a` tag to link each citation in the text to the corresponding reference at the bottom of the document. I assigned id attributes to each reference, allowing me to create internal links from the citations in the paper body to the reference list. This greatly improved navigation and made the document more interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Styling Challenges: I initially struggled with styling the content inline, which made the HTML cluttered and hard to manage. After researching best practices, I created a `style` block in the `head` section to centralize the CSS. This made it easier to manage and edit styles, especially for the table and headings. I used border-collapse: collapse; to ensure the table cells shared borders and added some padding for better readability. This separation of style and content made the HTML cleaner and easier to update.

    <script type="text/javascript">
         var x = document.lastModified;
         document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>

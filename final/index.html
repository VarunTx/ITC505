        <h2>For Addendum</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring the board starts in a solvable state was challenging. Randomly toggling lights using simulated clicks helped address this.</li>
            <li>Handling edge and corner cells required careful neighbor-toggling logic to avoid errors.</li>
            <li>Integrating smooth transitions for visual feedback took time but enhanced user experience.</li>
            <li>Testing and debugging edge cases (e.g., solving with few moves) revealed flaws in the initial implementation, which were corrected.</li>
            <li>Gaining insights on how toggling affects game solvability gave a deeper understanding of algorithmic design.</li>
        </ul>
